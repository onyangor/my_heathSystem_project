        Slide 2: Introduction
Problem Statement:
Health organizations often face challenges in managing large volumes of client and program information efficiently.
Traditional methods (manual records, scattered systems) can cause errors, data loss, and inefficiencies.

         Objective of the System:

Develop a simple, modern Health Information System.
Allow doctors to easily:
Create and manage health programs (e.g., TB, Malaria, HIV).
Register new clients and store their information.
Enroll clients into one or more health programs.
Search and view client profiles.
Expose client data through an API for external system integrations.
               Goal:
To streamline healthcare data management, improve service delivery, and enable secure data sharing.

        Slide 3: System Overview
Describe the main components of the system:
Health programs (e.g., TB, Malaria).
Clients and client profiles.
Enrollments and program management.
API endpoints for interaction.

       Slide 4: System Design
Show a high-level architecture diagram of the system.
Frontend: Swagger UI (or Postman for testing).
Backend: FastAPI and SQLite (or your database choice).
API: CRUD operations for handling programs and clients.

       Slide 5: API Endpoints
POST /programs: Create new health program.
POST /clients: Register new client.
POST /enroll: Enroll a client in a program.
GET /clients/{client_id}: View a clientâ€™s profile.
GET /programs: View all programs.

       Slide 6: Technology Stack
Technologies used:
Backend Framework: FastAPI.
Database: SQLite (or any database used).
Testing: Swagger UI, Postman, Pytest.
Deployment: Local or cloud (if applicable).

       Slide 7: Challenges and Solutions
Challenge 1: Client Enrollment to Multiple Programs

Problem:
Allowing a client to enroll in one or many health programs without duplicating records.

Solution:
Implemented a many-to-many relationship using a join table between clients and programs via SQLAlchemy ORM.

Challenge 2: Managing API Responses

Problem:
Ensuring clean, consistent, and informative API responses for different operations (success, failure, validation errors).

Solution:
Used Pydantic models for structured response schemas and FastAPI exception handling to manage errors gracefully.

Challenge 3: Data Validation

Problem:
Preventing invalid data entries (like missing client names or duplicate program names).

Solution:
Applied Pydantic validation rules and added unique constraints at the database level.

Challenge 4: Exposing Client Profile Securely

Problem:
Sharing client profiles publicly while keeping data safe and controlled.

Solution:
Created a separate public API endpoint with limited fields exposed to external systems.

        Slide 8: Conclusion

Key Features of the Health Information System:

Health Program Management: Easily create and manage various health programs (e.g., TB, Malaria, HIV).
Client Registration: Register new clients with essential information (name, contact details).
Client Enrollment: Enroll clients into one or more programs.
Search and Profile Viewing: Search for clients and view detailed profiles, including their enrolled programs.
Public API Access: Expose client data through secure, structured API endpoints for integration with other systems.

Potential Improvements & Future Features:

Authentication & Authorization: Implement secure access control for system users, allowing roles (e.g., admin, doctor, client) with specific permissions.
Data Security: Enhance client data security with encryption and other privacy measures.
Cloud Integration: Deploy the system to a cloud platform for high availability and scalability.
Mobile Application: Build a mobile app for easy client registration, enrollment, and health program management.
Analytics: Add dashboards for health program analytics and insights (e.g., program participation rates, client demographics).

   Conclusion:
The Health Information System streamlines the management of health programs and client data, offering a modern, efficient solution for healthcare organizations.
With further enhancements, it could become a comprehensive platform for healthcare service delivery.
